Object Detection Using Adaptive Mask RCNN
About Dataset : 
The VHR-10 dataset is a collection of Very High Resolution remote sensing images of 10 classes, provided by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in China.

Comprising a total of 800 VHR optical remote sensing images, 715 of these are color images acquired from Google Earth with spatial resolutions between 0.5 to 2 meters. The remaining 85 are color-infrared (CIR) images pan-sharpened, obtained from the Vaihingen dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.08 meters.

The dataset is divided into two sets:

Positive image set (650 images): Images containing at least one object of interest.
Negative image set (150 images): Images with no objects of interest.
The positive image set includes objects from the following ten classes:

Airplanes (757)
Ships (302)
Storage tanks (655)
Baseball diamonds (390)
Tennis courts (524)
Basketball courts (159)
Ground track fields (163)
Harbors (224)
Bridges (124)
Vehicles (477)
It includes object detection bounding boxes and instance segmentation masks.
